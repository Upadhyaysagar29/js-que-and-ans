    <li><h1>Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h1></li>

    <li> <h3>== (Equality Operator):

        Checks for value equality only. </h3> <br>
         <h3> === (Strict Equality Operator):

Checks for both value and type equality.
Does not perform type coercion. </h3>

    </li>

    <li><h1>What are the differences between var, let and const?</h1></li>

    <li><h3>var:

        Function-scoped.
        Can be re-declared and updated.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>let:

        Block-scoped.
        Cannot be re-declared in the same scope but can be updated.</h3> <br>

        <h3>const:

            Block-scoped.
            Cannot be re-declared or updated.</h3>
    
    </li>

<li><h1>What is execution context</h1></li>

    <li><h3>Global Execution Context (GEC):
        Created when a JavaScript file runs.
        Responsible for managing global variables and functions. <br> <br>
        Function Execution Context (FEC):
        Created when a function is invoked.
        Has its own variables, function declarations, and this.</h3></li>


<li><h1>What is creation phase and execution phase</h1></li>

        <li><h3>
            Creation Phase:

            Memory is allocated for variables and functions.
            Variables are set to undefined, and functions are hoisted.
            The scope chain and this are set. <br> <br>
            
            Execution Phase:
            
            Code is executed line by line.
            Variables are assigned actual values, and functions are executed.</h3></li>


<li><h1>What is hoisting?</h1></li>

            <li><h3>
                Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where:
Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope during the creation phase.
            </h3> </li>


<li><h1>Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN</h1></li>
<li>
                <h3>
                    undefined:

A variable is declared but not initialized.

                </h3>
                <h3>not defined:

                    A variable has not been declared.</h3>
                <h3>NaN (Not-a-Number):

                    Represents a value that is not a valid number.</h3>
            </li>

            <br>

<li><h1> How many operators do we have in JS ? </h1></li>

            <li>
<h3>
  Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %, ** <br>
Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, etc. <br>
<li>Comparison Operators: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <,    </li>     
<li>  Logical Operators: &&, ||, !              </li>            
Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>          <br>
String Operators: +, +=                <br>
Conditional (Ternary) Operator: ? : <br>

<li><h1> Explain Local Scope, Block Scope, Functional Scope and Scope Chain in javascript</h1></li>

            <li><h3>Local Scope:

                Variables declared inside a function.
                Accessible only within that function.</h3></li>

                <li><h3>Block Scope:

                    Variables declared with let or const inside a block ({}).
                    Accessible only within that block.</h3></li>

                    <li><h3>
                        Functional Scope:

Applies to var. Variables declared with var are function-scoped.
                    </h3></li>

                    <li><h3>Scope Chain:

                        Defines how JavaScript looks for variables.
                        Starts with the current scope and moves up to parent scopes.</h3></li>
